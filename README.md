This repository contains examples of several uncommon errors that might arise in Python programming and provides solutions for handling them effectively. The errors covered include:

1. **FloatingPointError:** Demonstrates the exception raised when working with mathematical functions like `math.log()` with invalid inputs.
2. **RecursionError:** Showcases how exceeding the maximum recursion depth leads to an error.
3. **Improper Library Usage:** Illustrates issues stemming from using libraries (NumPy in this case) incorrectly.
4. **ZeroDivisionError:** Illustrates the handling of division by zero.
5. **TypeError:** Illustrates the handling of type errors during operations such as division.

Each error is demonstrated with code examples, and solutions or error-handling mechanisms are provided.
